# :sunrise_over_mountains: Choose Your Path

## Overview
Welcome to Choose Your Path! This site helps people pick a segment of the East Coast Trail to hike. They can also record a diary entry to help them remember their day.

## Description

To decide which East Coast Trail path you want to hike you can get suggestions based on the following attributes:

1. Length of the path.
2. Difficulty rating as determined by the east Coast Trail Association.

Once you decide how far you want to go and how difficult you want your hike you'll get a list of suggestions and the trailheads will be displayed on a map.

Make an entry in your trail diary so you can keep track of where you've been and what your favourite paths are.

## :seedling: Motivation

Sometimes you just want a quick and easy trail and sometimes you want more of a commitment. I wanted to make it easier to find a hike that matches your mood, abilities, and time available. There are also times I've sat watching a pod of whales breaching for almost and hour or found an amazing berry patch and can't remember which path I was on! That's what the diary is for. 
This is my Module 1 Get Coding project and helped me in learning to code.
