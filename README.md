# Pick A Trail
This website will help people pick a segment of the East Coast Trail to hike based on attributes they're interested in. It will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description
This site will provide several attributes that can be selected to help users choose which portion of the East Coast Trail they would like to hike. The attributes that I would like to start with are:

1)	Driving time or distance from your location to the trail head.
2)	Length of the segment of the trail.
3)	Difficulty rating as determined by the east Coast Trail Association.
4)	Elevation range.

Further attributes to be added if time allows would be natural features (waterfall, sea stack, etc.) and archaeological/historical features (root cellars, historic plaques, etc.).

It will also include links to the Environment Canada Weather Forecast site and the Government of Canada Sunrise/Sunset Calculator.

## Motivation
This project will help me improve my HTML and CSS skills and learn JavaScript. It will also bring in my background in GIS by using either the Goole Maps API or the ArcGIS SDK to calculate distances or drive times from the userâ€™s address to the trail heads.
